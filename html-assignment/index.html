        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Zhang Xiaoyu, or you can call me bettie if you like. I am 19 years old and I come from the beautiful city of Yantai, China. I am cheerful, sincere and docile. I like to travel and cook. Although I love to cook, <strong>I am a kitchen killer.</strong> I am a person who likes new things, but most of the time it is a passing craze.</p>
        <p>At present, I am studying <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> at Algonquin College on January 6<sup>th</sup>. I hope I can shine in this position in the future and become the most ideal person in my heart. And I hope that my future work will be done because I love it. But my motto in life is <em>cherish the present. -Bettie</em></p>
